# Threading-Demo

This was made for hths.hacks(), 5-16-2020.

I made this project to learn and put to use the concept of multithreading, in the language I am most familiar with, Java. Multithreading is a way to execute multiple tasks essentially simultaneously on the same CPU, which helps with efficiency. I created a program that initialized 3 different threads to simultaneously increment the first 10 integers. The program printed the thread value and the calculated value for each iteration within each thread. Through the creation of this program, I was able to concretely understand the basic usage and implementation of multithreading.
